This is a Photoshop PSD placeholder file for a game poster template. Please open and edit in Photoshop or Photopea to customize. The recommended structure is:
- Backgrounds (abstract, cityscape, fantasy, sci-fi, overlays)
- FX (light flares, smoke, action strokes)
- Main Art (Smart Object placeholder)
- Title (bold text, subtitle, effects)
- Info (release date, tagline, developer)
- Logos & Badges (game logo, platform icons)
- Social & Web (icons, hashtag, URL)
- Adjustment Layers (color grading, glitch, sharpen)

To use: Replace Main Art with your game visual, edit titles, and switch backgrounds as needed. File is A3 size, 300 DPI for print.

(Note: This is a placeholder text file. To convert to a true PSD, open in Photoshop, create folders/layers as described, and save as PSD. If you want a generated PSD file with real layers, contact the developer or use Photopea scripting.)
